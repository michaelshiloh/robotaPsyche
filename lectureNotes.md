#### Announcements

- I made a mistake and had to change the Zoom meeting URL. I have updated all
	the pages on Github with the new Zoom URL which is
	[this](https://nyu.zoom.us/j/98342686561)
- Since the first meeting was with the old link, you won't be able to
	find that meeting recording in Brightspace. However you can access
	the first meeting recording
	[here](https://nyu.zoom.us/rec/share/tQRkXacgvLkqUDX6ad8ynEdxvA9r6r4ykmuTULpRTFogmlWFajUc7UPNm7gM-CtC.GV4Cue80NDdWXG3i)

#### Homework (maybe after the break)
- Let's take a quick look at your ideas

#### Review

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/tree/master/src/p5jsSketches/simpleP5jsClassExample)

- [PVectors](https://natureofcode.com/book/)
	- I think we got to vector subtraction, and the example that draws
		a line from center of the canvas to the mouse
	- Continue with Vector multiplication (and division)
	- 1.5 Vector Magnitude
	- 1.6 Normalizing Vectors
- Finally let's put this to use
	- 1.7 Vector Motion: Velocity (we looked at this last week)
	- 1.8 Vector Motion: Acceleration
	- 1.9 Static vs. Non-Static Functions
