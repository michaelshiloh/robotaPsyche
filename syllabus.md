### Course Description
What can machines tell us about the human condition? Is something that appears to be
intelligent, really intelligent? Is a device that appears to have likes and dislikes “alive”? As robots
and Artificial Intelligence become more powerful and prolific, what makes us unique?
This course will address these questions by exploring a series of increasingly complex software
"creatures" which seem to have qualities usually associated with living beings. This course will
primarily follow a classic text that proposes "experiments in synthetic psychology", with
excursions into cybernetics and how it relates to art.
Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical components. Readings include
critical analysis regarding the historical and contemporary theories and practices in these fields.
Students will develop software "vehicles" which will embody the ideas being explored. By
creating and simulating multiple and increasingly complex vehicles, interactions and behaviors
will be explored.

### Learning Outcomes: 
1. Develop a critical understanding of the historical and contemporary meaning of cybernetics
1. Create a software robot to simulate and exhibit various synthetic psychologies
1. Create multiple software robots with minor variations and explore how these robots interact
with each other, and explore how successful variations can be propagated while unsuccessful
variation die out
1. Use software robots to create artwork
1. Understand the fundamental concept of chaos, that small changes in initial conditions result in
vastly different outcomes
1. Understand how seemingly human behavior can emerge from a relatively simple set of rules


### Teaching and Learning Methodology
This is a production-based course that involves programming. Examples will be presented and
discussed throughout, and students will be required to write their own programs, read articles,
ask questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion. The course embraces a
process-oriented philosophy believing that programming is best learned by doing, and that
understanding is best developed by engaging in critical discussion.

In a way, this class has three tracks:
1. Readings and discussion
1. Skills
1. Projects

### Weekly Schedule
Course topics and contents on a week-by-week basis, 
including reading, writing, and production assignments and due dates, 
are [here](weeklyScheudle.md)


### Course Assignments

This course consists of theoretical readings, discussions, and technical training in programming.
Weekly programming assignments will reinforce skills taught in class, and will require students
to develop creative solutions. Assignment documentation is also required.
Weekly reading assignments will explore theoretical, critical, and creative aspects of cybernetics
and synthetic psychology. Each student will be responsible for leading the class in discussing
the reading at least once during the semester.
Students will be required to write a presentation on a topic of their choice from a list of options.
Two intermediate and one final project, along with documentation, will be assigned.

### Project documentation:

All student work (weekly assignments, projects, and presentations) will be uploaded and handed
in via github. Instructions will be given in class. Project and assignment documentation is to include: Clear description, technical principles of operation, creative and technical decisions,
influences and inspiration, key challenges and solutions, overall lessons learned, and relevant
references and resources. Pictures and videos must be included where relevant. Code must be
well-organized, clear, and meaningfully commented. Variables, functions, classes, and objects
must have meaningful names. Unused variables, functions, or commented-out code must be
justified and explained.

#### Student-Led Discussions:

Throughout the semester there will be readings assigned to students
to lead subsequent discussion regarding the readings (or videos).
To encourage critical engagement with the readings, a critical question
inspired by the reading must be posted before class on the day the reading is
due. Questions must be different from those other students have posted.

Instructions to participants:

* If you are the type of person who is comfortable speaking in class, pause
	for a moment before you speak or raise your hand to allow those who are shy 
	to have a chance.
* If you are someone who tends to be quiet, please use this opportunity to
	practice speaking. You are among friends and what you have to say is
	important to us all. Participation is part of your grade and there are no wrong answers.
* Don’t repeat what someone has already said
* Don’t just say that you liked or disliked the reading. Offer critical insight. 
	Why did you like or dislike it? What does it connect to?
	Does it remind you of something you know or think about?
	Did it change your mind about something?

Instructions to leader:

You have 15 minutes. Allow 3-5 minutes at the end to wrap up, so
divide the remaining 12-15 minutes into your questions or topics (say
2-5 minutes each) and move on to the next question or topic even if
there are still hands raised Make sure you know what you think the key
points of the reading are, and what is important for everyone to take
away from the reading.  Ask questions that engage the class fully in
critical discussion of the readings. Lead people to the main points of
the reading through questions, but don’t tell people the main points. 

#### Final Project

Details will be provided later in the semester

#### Attendance

Attendance in all classes is mandatory. Be on time and ready to start work at
the posted start time.  Arriving more than ten minutes late to class will
count as an unexcused absence.  Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will
negatively impact your final grade for the class. 

More than one unexcused absence will result in a 5-percentage point drop in
your attendance grade per absence. After four unexcused absences, you will
fail the class.

If you know you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If
you have an emergency, let me know as soon as you can.  To receive an excused
absence, you must ask in advance, and receive permission from me.
Excusable absences include family emergencies, job interviews, vastly
different time zones, presenting at a conference, and poor internet
connectivity.

In order to receive credit for an excused absence, you must watch the 
recording and write about it. 
If you miss a discussion, you must write about the subject discussed. 
If you miss a lecture, you must write questions on the subject of the
lecture.

#### Participation

Engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and input in the class
is a major part of your grade. Participating in class discussions is helpful
for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress,
but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates with the opportunity
to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.

You are expected to show work in class. This includes working prototypes,
failed assignments, things that don’t work the way you expect, and so forth.
Each week some time is given over to your work, expect to be called on and
show something. Don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did, or failed
to do.

If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material
completely. Asking questions about concepts you do not understand and showing
work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an
opportunity to learn.

#### Laptops:

Laptop use is fine if you are using your laptop to present in class, or if
we’re in the middle of an exercise that makes use of it. Whenever classmates
are presenting or we’re in the midst of a class discussion, please keep your
laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your
attention and active participation, so please respect that and close your lid.

During online instruction you must not use your laptop for anything not
necessary for the class.

#### Zoom:

Have your camera turned on during class so we can all see each other. This
really helps the cohesion of the class while we are doing remote learning. If
you have a special reason why you need to have your camera turned off please
email me with the details of why and we can discuss.

#### Mobile Phones:

Do not use your phone in class unless it is part of the lesson.
If you
have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please
tell me ahead of time.￼

#### Homework exercises
Occasional homework exercises will be used to deepen understanding and
familiarity with technical material such as electronics and programming. All
material will be provided in the required course kit.

#### Projects

Details will be provided in class

#### Textbooks

All required and supplemental textbooks will be provided by the library through NYU Classes.
Textbooks are listed
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#resources-for-robota-psyche)

#### Communicate

If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction,
please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via email, sign up for
office hours, speak with me before class, or after class.
Please let me know if you have any concerns about the material or your
progress in the course. I am very willing to help, but you have to take the
first step of reaching out to me.

#### Academic Integrity

As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship
between students and faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared
commitment to academic excellence and is grounded in an expectation of
fairness, honesty, and respect, which are essential to maintaining the
integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts
an appointment as a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to
abide by the expectation of academic honesty.  The full policies and
procedures relating to Academic Integrity may be found on the [NYUAD Student
Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/campus-life/student-policies/community-standards-policies/academic-integrity/)

#### Online Journal

Students must document all their work in their Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

The purpose of the journal is threefold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate that you are keeping up with the work in the class and that you are grasping the material. I read the journals to see how you are doing. 

Second, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use. You must
update the journal each week with the work you have done for class. You should
use the journal as an opportunity to write clearly write your thoughts,
questions, and analysis based on the class assignments. The writing is
expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You should link to any
relevant sources, and provide context, such as images, video or audio, when
appropriate. 

Third, we all make extensive use of online resources generously created by
others. By sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned
available in the hopes that others might benefit.
