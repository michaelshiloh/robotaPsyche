### Course Description
What can machines tell us about the human condition? Is something that appears
to be intelligent, really intelligent? Is a device that appears to have likes
and dislikes “alive”? As robots and Artificial Intelligence become more
powerful and prolific, what makes us unique?  This course will address these
questions by exploring a series of increasingly complex software "creatures"
which seem to have qualities usually associated with living beings. This
course will primarily follow a classic text that proposes "experiments in
synthetic psychology", with excursions into cybernetics and how it relates to
art.  Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical
components. Readings include critical analysis regarding the historical and
contemporary theories and practices in these fields.  Students will develop
software "vehicles" which will embody the ideas being explored. By creating
and simulating multiple and increasingly complex vehicles, interactions and
behaviors will be explored.

### Course Learning Outcomes: 
The Course Learning Outcomes are indicated below, along with the corresponding
Program Learning Outcome. A description of the Program Learning Outcomes
(PLOs) is at the end of this document:

1. Develop a critical understanding of the historical and contemporary meaning of cybernetics (PLO 1)
1. Create a software robot to simulate and exhibit various synthetic psychologies (PLO 5, 6)
1. Create multiple software robots with minor variations and explore how these robots interact 
with each other, and explore how successful variations can be propagated while unsuccessful
variation die out (PLO 3, 5, 6)
1. Use software robots to create artwork (PLO 6)
1. Understand the fundamental concept of chaos, that small changes in initial conditions result in
vastly different outcomes (PLO 2, 5)
1. Understand how seemingly human behavior can emerge from a relatively simple set of rules (PLO 3)


### Teaching and Learning Methodology
This is a production-based course that involves programming. Examples will be
presented and discussed throughout, and students will be required to write
their own programs, read articles, ask questions, and engage in both creative
and technical discussion. The course embraces a process-oriented philosophy
believing that programming is best learned by doing, and that understanding is
best developed by engaging in critical discussion.

In a way, this class has three tracks:
1. Readings and discussion
1. Skills
1. Projects

### Weekly Schedule
Course topics and contents on a week-by-week basis, 
including reading, writing, and production assignments and due dates, 
are [here](weeklyScheudle.md)


### Course Assignments

This course consists of theoretical readings, discussions, and advanced
programming concepts.  Weekly programming assignments will reinforce skills
taught in class, and will require students to develop creative solutions.
Assignment documentation is also required.  Weekly reading assignments will
explore theoretical, critical, and creative aspects of cybernetics and
synthetic psychology. Each student will be responsible for leading the class
in discussing the reading at least once during the semester.  Students will be
required to write a presentation on a topic of their choice from a list of
options.  Two intermediate and one final project, along with documentation,
will be assigned.

### Project documentation:

All student work (weekly assignments, projects, and presentations) will be
uploaded and handed in via github. Instructions will be given in class.
Project and assignment documentation is to include: Clear description,
technical principles of operation, creative and technical decisions,
influences and inspiration, key challenges and solutions, overall lessons
learned, and relevant references and resources. Pictures and videos must be
included where relevant. Code must be well-organized, clear, and meaningfully
commented. Variables, functions, classes, and objects must have meaningful
names. Unused variables, functions, or commented-out code must be justified
and explained.

#### Student-Led Discussions:

This class is not a programming class, although we will be doing lots of
programming. This class is about trying to come to grips with what intelligent
robots might mean to the human experience. 

No one knows the answer yet, so there is no right or wrong answer to this
question. Instead, I expect you to engage personally and critically with the
material, to try to figure out your opinions and feelings, and to discuss
deeply.

Readings have been selected to present different points of view and to look at
the question from different angles.

It is important that everyone participate in reading closely, analyzing
critically, discussing critically, and questioning each other. Students who do
not participate critically in our discussions will not get credit for
participation. If you are unable to participate in discussions for any reason
contact me for alternative ways to demonstrate your critical engagement.

Please complete reading assignments in advance and come prepared to discuss
them in class. If necessary, use a dictionary to look up unfamiliar terms.
Mark down relevant passages and take notes about these so that you have them
handy to refer to in class.  Reading actively is a key component of active
participation and necessary to develop critical and analytical skills. Use the
space of the classroom to test your insights without the pressures associated
with written assignments, and listen to what your classmates think. Feel free
to ask questions of your classmates and me. Students are expected to come to
office hours when they have questions or would like extra help.

Students will take turns leading the discussions.

Instructions to participants:

* If you are the type of person who is comfortable speaking in class, pause
	for a moment before you speak or raise your hand to allow those who are shy 
	to have a chance.
* If you are someone who tends to be quiet, please use this opportunity to
	practice speaking. You are among friends and what you have to say is
	important to us all. Participation is part of your grade and there are no
	wrong answers.
* Don’t repeat what someone has already said
* Don’t just say that you liked or disliked the reading. Offer critical
	insight.  Why did you like or dislike it? What does it connect to?  Does it
	remind you of something you know or think about?  Did it change your mind
	about something?

Instructions to leader:

You have 15 minutes. Allow 3-5 minutes at the end to wrap up, so
divide the remaining 12-15 minutes into your questions or topics (say
2-5 minutes each) and move on to the next question or topic even if
there are still hands raised Make sure you know what you think the key
points of the reading are, and what is important for everyone to take
away from the reading.  Ask questions that engage the class fully in
critical discussion of the readings. Lead people to the main points of
the reading through questions, but don’t tell people the main points. 

#### Final Project

Details will be provided later in the semester

#### Attendance

Attendance in all classes is mandatory. Be on time and ready to start work at
the posted start time.  Arriving more than ten minutes late to class will
count as an unexcused absence.  Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will
negatively impact your final grade for the class. 

More than one unexcused absence will result in a 5-percentage point drop in
your attendance grade per absence. After four unexcused absences, you will
fail the class.

If you know you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If
you have an emergency, let me know as soon as you can.  To receive an excused
absence, you must ask in advance, and receive permission from me.
Excusable absences include family emergencies, job interviews, vastly
different time zones, presenting at a conference, and poor internet
connectivity.

In order to receive credit for an excused absence, you must watch the 
recording and write about it. 
If you miss a discussion, you must write about the subject discussed. 
If you miss a lecture, you must write questions on the subject of the
lecture.

#### Participation

Engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and input in the class
is a major part of your grade. Participating in class discussions is helpful
for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress,
but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates with the opportunity
to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.

You are expected to show work in class. This includes working prototypes,
failed assignments, things that don’t work the way you expect, and so forth.
Each week some time is given over to your work, expect to be called on and
show something. Don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did, or failed
to do.

If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material
completely. Asking questions about concepts you do not understand and showing
work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an
opportunity to learn.

#### Engagement

Students are required to be fully engaged during class and to give their full
attention to the speaker, whether it's me or one of your fellow students.

##### Laptops

Laptop use is fine if you are using your laptop to present in class, or if
we’re in the middle of an exercise that makes use of it. Whenever classmates
are presenting or we’re in the midst of a class discussion, please keep your
laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your
attention and active participation, so please respect that and close your lid.

During online instruction you must not use your laptop for anything not
necessary for the class.

##### Zoom

Have your camera turned on during class so we can all see each other. This
really helps the cohesion of the class while we are doing remote learning. If
you have a special reason why you need to have your camera turned off please
email me with the details of why and we can discuss.

If your camera is off without permission it will be considered an unexcused
absence.

##### Mobile Phones

Do not use your phone in class unless it is part of the lesson.  If you have
an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please tell
me ahead of time.￼

##### Notifications

Turn off all notifications on your laptop and your phone. Notifications are
distracting, intrusive, and rude and will not be tolerated.

#### Projects

Details will be provided in class

#### Textbooks

All required and supplemental textbooks will be provided by the library through NYU Brightspace. To access them follow these steps:
1. Log in to nyu.bright
1. Select the "Content" tab
1. Note that some books are in the "Resources" tab and some are in "External Resources" 
Textbooks are listed

#### Communicate

If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction,
please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via email, discord, or
request office hours.  Please let me know if you have any concerns about the
material or your progress in the course. I am very willing to help, but you
have to take the first step of reaching out to me.

#### Academic Integrity

As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship
between students and faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared
commitment to academic excellence and is grounded in an expectation of
fairness, honesty, and respect, which are essential to maintaining the
integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts
an appointment as a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to
abide by the expectation of academic honesty.  The full policies and
procedures relating to Academic Integrity may be found on the [NYUAD Student
Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/campus-life/student-policies/community-standards-policies/academic-integrity/)

#### Documentation

Students must document all their work in their Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

Your papers will also be handed in on your Github repository

The writing is expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You
should link to any relevant sources, and provide context, such as images,
video or audio, when appropriate. 

We all make extensive use of online resources generously created by others. By
sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned available in the
hopes that others might find it useful.
