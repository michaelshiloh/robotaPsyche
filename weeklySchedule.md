#### Assignments Due February 2

In class on Monday we finished learning about PVectors and saw an example of
how we could create an array of objects (movers, bugs, robots, etc.) that
would each be governed by the same set of rules, but each object would respond
in slightly different ways. Think about other movers you might define and what
rules would govern them. No writing is necessary.

#### Assignments starting February 7

Starting on February 7 we will have one presentations and reading discussions:
- Monday: One presentation and one reading discussion
	- Except for February 7 we will only have a reading
- Wednesday: One presentation

Guidelines for presentations:
- About 15 minutes long
- Must include discussion points or questions
- Following the presentation will be about 5 minutes of discussion
- Each presenter will be selected 2 weeks before they are due to speak
- Schedule for presentations is [here](studentPresentations.md)

Guidelines for discussion leaders:
- Read closely, take notes, come up with questions and points
- Meet with your partner, discuss, and try to answer each other’s questions

#### Production Assignment Due February 14

The Ecosystem Project from the book, with some modifications:

One way to use this book is to build a single
project over the course of reading it, incorporating elements from each
chapter one step at a time. We’ll follow the development of an example project
throughout this book—a simulation of an ecosystem. Imagine a population of
computational creatures swimming around a digital pond, interacting with each
other according to various rules.

Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature,
such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc.
Give the creature a personality through its behavior and not through
its visual design. 

Using the code example above as inspiration (or as a starting place),
implement your creature.
Start with only one simple behavior and get that to work
well before you add anything else.

Do your creatures have a limited lifespan? How would you implement this? 
(Hint: There are some ideas in Chapter 4)
What
about hunger or energy level? If the creature is very hungry is it perhaps
less careful or more aggressive about approaching food?

Think about introducing other
elements into the environment (food, a predator) for the creature to interact
with. Does the creature experience attraction or repulsion to things in its
world? Can you think more abstractly and design forces based on the creature’s
desires or goals?

**Document your work**

- Take a short video or screen recording of your ecology in action
- In your Github repository create a folder called `February14`
- In that folder put your code with the proper `.pde` extension
	- Your code should be well organized; have excellent names for variables,
		functions, and classes; and have excellent comments
- In that folder create a file `README.md`
- Describe your project in README.md and include:
  - A description of your concept and how you tried to implement it
		- It is quite alright if you had to modify the concept
		as you learned what you could and could not accomplish
  - One or more screenshots of the outcome
  - Major problems, if any, and solutions, if any
  - Clever or difficult things you learned while implementing your ecology
  - A link to the video

	- **Important**: I have revised the instructions in the syllabus. Please
		read
		[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/robotaPsyche/blob/main/syllabus.md#student-led-discussions)

#### Reading Assignment Due February 28
Read the Preface and Introduction to [Science Fiction, Alien Encounters, and the Ethics of Posthumanism](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/tree/master/doc/ScienceFictionAlienEncountersAndTheEthicsOfPosthumanism) by Elana Gomel.
- Fatima and Yeji will lead our discussion

#### Midterm project Due March 9
- Your midterm project will be to develop a more complex ecology. You may
	continue with what you created for February 14, or you may create a new
	ecology.
- Full details below

#### Production Assignment Due February 28

Make progress on your midterm project either by elaborating on your February
14 ecology or by starting a new one
- Make a new folder called "midterm"
- In the midterm folder make a new file "README.md" and in that describe 
	briefly your concept
- In the midterm folder make a new file "journal.md" and in that describe 
	what progress you have made so far
- Each creature should have some different characteristics such as maximum
	speed, maximum force, hunger threshold, size, aggression factor, etc. Group
	all of these in a new class called "DNA". You don't need to implement it
	yet, but think about how two (or more?) creatures might reproduce to create
	a creature that has some mix of the parent's DNA. The later goal will be to
	see if our creatures can "improve" through natural selection.
- At the beginning of the course I had the vehicles bouncing off the walls. In
	retrospect that was not a good idea, it's more realistic (I think) if you
	allow them to roam over an infinite space, of which we only see the portion
	that is visible on the canvas. You may disagree, in which case think what
	role the wall plays in your ecology and what might happen when a creature
	collides with the wall. For example, the creature might be able to see the
	wall and slow down
- Use onscreen text (using the `text()` function) to give some indication of
	what's going on (e.g.  temperature, oxygen). At the very least, explain what
	each shape or color means.
- Be creative, whimsical, and experimental! You don't need to accurately
	depict real life. Make up imaginary creatures and their behaviors. Think
	outside the box! This is not required but is allowed and encouraged.
- Consider what else your mouse can do: enhance (or not) individual creators,
	change a flow field (wind, water current, a high mountain)
- Try to incorporate some of the new things we've learned in order to give
	your ecology a more interesting behavior

#### Further details of the midterm project
- Due March 9
- Your midterm project will be to develop a more complex ecology. You may
	continue with what you created for February 14, or you may create a new
	ecology. Incorporate various behaviors such as following a flow field,
	attraction, aggression, arriving, cohesion, separation, and flocking. You do
	not need to incorporate all of the behaviours that we learned about.
- Your project must have a legend indicating what different colors or shapes
represent, and other information that explains what's going on. If you are
using easily identified images you do not need the legend.
- Your description must be excellent and detailed and must include:
	- The concept
	- The process you took to achieve it
	- Problems if any, and solutions or workarounds
	- Anything interesting you discovered or learned
	- Any resources you found useful (tutorials, books, friends, ideas from
		other classes, etc.)
- Code must be extremely well organized and commented
	- Include a block at the beginning of the code with your name, short
		description of the project, class, and date
	- Explain each function (except for setup() and draw())
		- What it does
		- What the arguments are
		- How it works
	- Format your code properly using CONTROL T or COMMAND T
	- Excellent comments, especially for any confusing or tricky parts
	- Use functions, classes, and tabs as needed to organize your program
	- Use excellent variable, function, object, and class names
	- Any block that does something confusing deserves its own comment block
		explaining what it does and how it does it. Usually such a block should be
		a separate function (but not always).

- March 2: Presentation: Chinonyerem

#### Reading Assignment Due March 28

- Read (Phillip and Ben to lead)

	If you feel uncomfortable watching the episode you don't need to watch it.

#### Production Assignment Due March 30

- If you just got access to the class ecosystem Github repository,
please upload at least one file to verify that you have access.

#### Production Assignment Due April 4

Concept:

Add your ecosystem to the class ecosystem. We will do this in stages
- I anticipate many technical and other issues. We will solve them as the come
	up
- For now, don't worry about how it looks or whether it makes sense. 
The first step is to get it running, then we will tackle other problems

Process:

- Wrap your entire ecosystem in a class that will in contain everything in
	your ecosystem
- Your class should have these functions:
	- `setup()`
	- `draw()`
	- `mouseClicked()` (even if empty)
	- `keyPressed()` (even if empty)
	- Others as necessary
- Look at
	[example](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/src/processingSketches/robotaPsyche/allTogether/michaelsEcosystem.pde)
- Your class must not call these functions:
	- `size()`
	- `background()`
- Your environment must not have any anything that is outside of the class
- Copy your ecosystem into the class ecosystem repository
- Put a message on Discord so that I can test it

#### Reading Assignment Due April 4

Watch The Social Dilemma and come prepared to discuss 
(Sarah and Yiyang to lead).
- **This is a 90 minute movie so make sure you give yourself time to watch it**
- I sent you email with a link and password to access the movie. 
If you have trouble accessing the movie let me know.
