	Terminator)

  Email your topic to me, which I will put on our website.

	chosen [here](studentPresentations.md)

### Week 2 (January 25, 27)
Using PVectors to simulate physics, part I

#### Assignments Due February 1

Reading Assignment:

Production Assignment:

### Week 3 February 1 3
Using PVectors to simulate physics, part II

#### Assignments Due February 8

Reading Assignment:
- Read or watch the videos for chapters 1 and 2 of The Nature of Code
	- [Book](https://natureofcode.com/book/)
	- Video tutorials for 
	[chapter 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWJkvxQXIa8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZwSmtE13iJBcoI-r4y7iEc)

- Read or watch the videos for chapter 6 of The Nature of Code: . Autonomous Agents. Don't worry too much about the details of the math (such as 6.7 The Dot Product) as I will go over that.
	- [Book](https://natureofcode.com/book/)
	- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIz2L4tn5kM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YHt0dtyf4uiw8tKOxQLvlW)

Production Assignment:

- Make a car (or rocket) you can drive around with the arrows that points to
	which way you are going. Use the Mover class. There is no Attractor in this
	exercise. The left and right arrows make the mover move faster in that
	direction. You can use this code to detect the arrow keys:

````
void draw() {
}

// Register an interest in keyboard events
// by creating a keyPressed() function
void keyPressed() {
  if (key == CODED) {
    if (keyCode == LEFT) {
      println("you pressed the left arrow");

      // do something to make the mover move faster to the left
    }
  }
}
````

### Week 4 February 8 10
Autonomous Agents: Action Selection and Steering

#### Assignments Due February 10

Reading Assignment:
- Watch [this](https://vimeo.com/45851523) video. Pay attention to the use of
huge numbers of vehicles to create artwork, especially the algorithms
used to guide the vehicles and the
methods used to generate the artwork.
- Read **Vehicle 4** in *Vehicles* (Braitenberg) 
  accessible through our NYU Classes portal under *Resources*
- Work on your presentation so that you will be ready on the date assigned to
	you

Production Assignment:
- Come up with three different ideas for behaviour, such as *seeking*,
	*arriving*, *wandering*, or *staying away from walls*. At least one of thse
	should use a force field. Write them down in your notebook (or a computer
	file or on Github) and be prepared to share your ideas in class. You are
	not required to implement your ideas or to document them in your repository.

#### Assignments Due February 15

Reading Assignment:
- Read Chapter 5: Toys, Totems, and Tools, in *The Living Brain* (Walter)
  accessible through our NYU Classes portal under *Resources*
- If you're new to ArrayLists, you might want to watch
	[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnSJZ4qTcwY) tutorial. Dan 
	uses the Particles class as an examnple, but you can substitute any
	class or variable.

Production Assignment:

The purpose of this assignment is to get some practice creating and following
a flow field, so make sure you can get that to work with something simple
before you get ambitious and try to make a very elaborate flow field
- Create some sort of a flow field, You can either:
	- All vectors point to the middle of the canvas 
	(this is Exercise 6.6 in the book)
	- All vectors point to the mouse
	- Make a flow field from a PImage; for example, the
	PVectors point from dark to light colors (or vice versa)
	(this is Exercise 6.8 in the book)
	- Make up your own 
- Make a vehicle follow the flow field (code is in the lecture notes)
- Using an ArrayList, add vehicles in some way (maybe on mouse clicks or key
	press)
	- You do not need to worry about any interactions between vehicles
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named the date this assignment
is due (February_15)
	- Upload the code
	- Create a README.md and put in it
		- Any image of your finished assignment
		- Any difficulties you had
		- Any interesting things you learned or discovered
		- Any questions you have 

### Week 5 February 15 17

#### Assignments Due February 22

Reading Assignment:
- Read the Preface, Chapter 1, and Chapter 2 up to Linear versus Nonlinear
	Rabbits (page 22) in *Complexity: A Guided Tour* (Melanie Mitchell)
- Read **Vehicle 5** and **Vehicle 6** in *Vehicles* (Braitenberg) 

Production Assignment:
- Modify your behaviours as discussed in class:
	- Each behaviour returns the force but does not apply it
	- Create a new method called `applyForce()`
	which applies the force
- Start implementing evolution. Your code does not need to function yet:
	- Create a new class consisting of all the weights, 
		limits, and other fixed numbers that might make up an individual
		vehicle's personality. You may invent new ones (size? color?)
		Do not include velocity or location. Call this new class DNA. 
	- Each vehicle gets its own DNA object
	- The constructor for a vehicle should take the DNA as 
	an argument, along with any other necessary information you wish
	(such as initial location)
	- Create a new method in the Vehicle class called getDNA()
	which returns a vehicle's DNA object
	- In order to simulate  selection, in each frame, some vehicles do not
		survive, and some vehicles are copied.
		- Each vehicle is checked in some way, and some vehicles do not survive to
			the next frame. You get to decide what criterion to use. Note that if
			selection works, then the criterion you use to determine whether a
			vehicle lives or dies will determine what features will be selected
			(e.g. if you chose to let vehicles die when they leave the canvas, then
			your system will select vehicles that stay on the canvas.) Be creative!
			Write a method to test whether this vehicle survives or not.
		- How will you determine when vehicles are copied?
		- Think about what other changes will be necessary in order to simulate
			selection. 
- Documentation 
	- New folder called "February22" to include:
		- Your code
		- Readme:
			- Describe what decisions you made in implementing the above
			- Describe what you included in your DNA
			- Describe your criterion for survival

### Week 6 February 22 24
Evolution

#### Assignments Due March 1

Production Assignment:
- **Don't wait until Sunday to work on your assignment!**
- **If you have trouble ask for help on Discord!**
- Finish your evolution project. 
	- Simplify your project as much as necessary in order to make it run
	- I had to remove the `applyForce()` change discussed above. 
		It prevented me from doing something which I can't recall now.
		Feel free to remove it if it causes you trouble.
	- Your code should have the following features at a minimum:
		- New vehicles (or fish or rockets) are generated using the DNA of
			existing vehicles (or whatever). You may chose any means to decide 
			when to generate a new one, and whose DNA you copy.
		- Vehicles (or whatever) die at some point. Use any criteria.
	- If you get the minimal features working, then add this:
		- When the DNA is copied, make some minor changes to it 
- Two hints to help you debug:
	- Make only one or two vehicles
	- Use `println()` to help see what's going on
	- You may look at [my
		code](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/tree/master/src/processingSketches/robotaPsyche/evolution)
		for ideas or inspiration but note that I think it has some bugs. I will
		continue revising this. Feel free to ask me about it.
- Documentation 
	- New folder called "March1" to include:
		- Your code
		- Readme:
			- Describe what decisions you made in implementing the above
			- Describe what you included in your DNA
			- Describe your criterion for survival, removal, and regeneration
			- Describe any problems 
			- Describe any simplifications you had to make to meet the deadline
